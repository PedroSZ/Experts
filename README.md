The first is a fast-moving average trend line of twelve periods, the second one is a moving average trend line is a slow-moving average trendline of thirty periods, and the third trend line of twelve periods is invisible but is essential to mark the trend. When it crosses above the fast period's line there is a bullish trend, and when it is over the slow period's line trend it indicates a bearish trend.
